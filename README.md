# COMP305 HTML Practice

## Overview
This project is to help familiarize myself with the HTML language as well as the different possible elements to be used. 

## Project Goals
The goal is to know different elements so future HTML projects I do can be as clean and non-repetetive as possible

## Issues
I only ran into one issue, and that was tryig to push too much at once. I learned that files have to be less than 100 mb, unless you want to change settings.
